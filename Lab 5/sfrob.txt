Lab 

We run the different versions of sfrob with different input files of different sizes.
I typed the line "CS35L Fall 2017" multiple times in the file.

For 10 input lines

Command: time ./sfrob < input.txt

real    0m0.002s
user    0m0.001s
sys 0m0.000s

Command: time ./sfrobu < input.txt

real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.001s
sys 0m0.000s

For 250 input lines

Command: time ./sfrob < input.txt

real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.001s
sys 0m0.001s

Command: time ./sfrobu < input.txt

real    0m0.003s
user    0m0.000s
sys 0m0.002s

For 1000 input lines

Command: time ./sfrob < input.txt
real    0m0.005s
user    0m0.003s
sys 0m0.002s

Command: time ./sfrobu < input.txt
real    0m0.007s
user    0m0.003s
sys 0m0.003s

Using, the strace -o command and the wc -l command from earlier in the lab,
we can estimate how many system calls are made.

sfrob: for 250 lines -> 292 system calls and for 1000 lines -> 1084 system calls
sfrobu: for 250 lines -> 539 system calls and for 1000 lines -> 2039 system calls

For the buffered version of sfrob, it seems that there is a one to one linear relationship
between the number of input lines and comparisons. This makes sense because the program
is reading one byte at a time.

comparison ~= lines

For the unbuffered version of sfrob, for every input line, there seems to be two system calls 
being made. 

comparisons ~= 2*lines

Use the time command to compare the results of sfrob, sfrobu, sfrobs, sfrobu -f, and sfrobs -f
All using the same 1000 line file

sfrob
real    0m0.006s
user    0m0.003s
sys 0m0.002s

sfrobu 
real    0m0.008s
user    0m0.003s
sys 0m0.003s

sfrobs
real    0m0.008s
user    0m0.007s
sys 0m0.002s

sfrobu -f
real    0m0.010s
user    0m0.006s
sys 0m0.004s

sfrobs -f
real    0m0.010s
user    0m0.006s
sys 0m0.004s

As seen by the data, the sfrob program is the fastest. The buffered program makes less system calls per line
and therefore is a lot faster than the other ones. Additionally, we see that the -f slows down the sfrobu and sfrobs
commands slightly. They also run at very similar speeds, with and without the options.
