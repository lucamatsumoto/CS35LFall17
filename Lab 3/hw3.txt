1) The case_long_iso_time_style: line is part of a label for a goto command and
it is also repeated twice. This line is also part of a switch-case statement.
Because it is repeated twice and it is a switch statement, it would have simply
fallen through to the next case of case_long_iso_time_style. This means that we
can remove this line without causing any problems. It was most likely removed 
in order to avoid confusion and clean up code.

2) If a company adopt's Brady's patch, they need to be careful for translations
between non-English users. If an international user within the company
is not accustomed to that format, then it will be difficult to communicate 
within the company. Additionally, if the function dcgettext does not recognize
a translation, it will return the same value as long_time_format[i]. Therefore,
for locales that do not have translations, data can be returned in a language
that a user cannot understand. This would add to the company confusion.

3) The /dev/null file is basically an empty file. Running the script, we are
given this message.

File "/usr/lib64/python2.7/random.py", line 274, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
IndexError: list index out of range

This randline script reads every line of the file and selects the lines that are
randomly selected. As seen by the error message displayed, if the file is empty,
then it displays an IndexError.

4) To run the python3 command we must first change the path by using the command
export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH. Running this script on python3 gives the
error message, 

 File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

This is because python 3 has deprecated automatic tuple unpacking, meaning the 
use of a tuple as a parameter in a function to have a sequence argument 
automatically unpacked. The solution would be to use a single parameter instead,
with only a reference to the multiple arguments.
